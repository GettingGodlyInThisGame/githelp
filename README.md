# GitHelp
Python Script to help setting up Git and using Git
**This script is experimental and I take no responsibility if this causes you to fuck up your Repositories**

I made this script because I thought for some people git is pretty confusing so this should automate most needed tasks.

## Usage
```
god@Heaven:~/Desktop/dev/gitHelp$ python git.py

[1] - Create Repository.
[2] - Clone Repository.
[3] - Add Files.
[4] - Commit Repository.
[5] - Push Repository.
[6] - Pull Repository.
[7] - Get Log.
[8] - More Info.
[9] - Exit.


What Would You Like To Do: 1
